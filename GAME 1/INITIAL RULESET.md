SUNNFOLK NOMIC 1 INITIAL RULESET 


1. RULES

Each Rule is named with the following format: `[natural number]. [name]`. 
Should a Rule contradict another, the Rule named with the lowest number takes precedence. No two Rules have the same number or name. 


2. PLAYERS AND POINTS

A Player is someone who consents to being a Player and is recorded in #players along with their Point balance. 

A Player's Point balance is a whole number, initially 0. 
The first Player to reach 100 Points wins the game. 


3. PROPOSALS  

A message posted in #proposals, following the format below, is a Proposal; 
``` 
Proposal [natural number]

/Changes described here are applied to the Ruleset or gamestate./
``` 
A Proposal's number is 1 higher than the one preceding it. 

A Proposal is followed by a poll of the same name posted by the same Player, with the options "YES" and "NO" and a time limit of minimum 24 hours. 

If a Proposal's poll has more YES votes than NO votes when it closes, it "passes", i.e. it is effective, and the Player who posted it gains 5 Points.
