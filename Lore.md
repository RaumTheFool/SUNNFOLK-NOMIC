## SfN 2

### 0. GAME 

- the game is played through a total of 8 weekly sessions of 1.5 hours each, where the core playerbase of 6 people meet physically. 
- the game will allow non-core players to also play, outside of these sessions.
- Klark represents ChatGPT. here are some ideas:
  - Klark creates 3 proposals that players vote on each session, being the primary way the rules change. 
  - Klark is a player whose actions are dictated by GPT, i.e. "assume the role of Klark and decide what he does this session" (i dont like this one, it can quickly get complicated, hard to moderate and understand - unless we find a better way to do it).
  - Klark is a storyteller with the power to propose new locations, characters and events (or maybe just events where the players are characters). the nomic is roleplay-centered.
