## LET'S PLAY NOMIC

nomic is the game of all games, where there is a written ruleset explaining how players can change the game's rules, through democracy. 

you play by posting messages in the discord. if you suggest a rule change that passes (ppl vote yes), you get a point. when someone reaches 100 points, they win! 

a proposal can be anything from "i win now" to "there's an item shop and u can buy items and use them to make stuff happen". anything is possible! 

the purpose is to play, experiment, and design a game *while* playing it (or if u wanna win, find loopholes and break the game to your favor). 

there's no requirement to actually participate (yet), so it's entirely possible to join the server just to check it out or watch from the sidelines. the game can last all from 3 minutes to 30 years, and will progress however fast we want. do nothing, everything, anything!
