# SUNNFOLK NOMIC 1st RULESET 


### 1. RULES (R)

Each Rule is named with the following format: `[natural number]. [name]`. 
Should a Rule contradict another, the Rule named with the lowest number takes precedence. 
No two Rules have the same number or name. 


### 2. PLAYERS AND POINTS

A Player is someone who consents to being a Player and is recorded in #players along with their Point balance. 

A Player's Point balance is a whole number, initially 0. 
The first Player to reach 100 Points wins the game. 


### 3. BOOKKEEPERS AND ELECTIONS 

A @Bookkeeper enforces the Rules. 
From the moment a Player calls for an Election in #play, Players have 12 hours to reply to it with the name of one Player. 
Given their explicit consent, the Player whose name was iterated most frequently through this process becomes the new @Bookkeeper and the former loses said role. 
Should a @Bookkeeper meet the win condition per Rule "PLAYERS AND POINTS", they do not win. 


### 4. TRANSFER OF POINTS 

All rules pertaining to the transfer of points should be posted under this rule.

If both players consent, points can be transferred from one player to another. 
You can only receive points from another player once per day. 
The transfer of points only takes place if it is announced in a proposed new “Transactions” text chat in the Sunnfolk Nomics discord server, and the transaction is approved by a bookkeeper. 


### 5. PROPOSALS (P)

A message posted in #proposals, following the format below, is a Proposal; 
``` 
Proposal [natural number]

[Changes described here are applied to the Ruleset or gamestate.]
``` 
A Proposal's number is 1 higher than the one preceding it. 
A Proposal that is edited contains an addendum with /slash brackets/ explaining why it was edited. 
Text in slash brackets have no legal effects.

A Proposal is followed by a poll of the same name posted by the same Player, with the options "YES" and "NO" and a time limit of minimum 24 hours. 

If a Proposal's poll has more YES votes than NO votes when it closes, it "passes", i.e. it is effective, and the Player who posted it gains 5 Points. 
If the vote is unanimous, they gain an additional 5 Points. Each Player who votes on a Proposal's poll gains 1 Point when it closes. 

Once you have posted a proposal, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes (max twelve hours) before posting its poll. During this time, any clarifying questions can be asked, and any edits can be made. 
You cannot edit a proposal after its poll has been posted.

If a player votes on their own proposal poll, their own vote is invalid and a penalty of 1 point is deducted from their total
