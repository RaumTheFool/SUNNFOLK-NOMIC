## LET'S PLAY NOMIC

nomic is the game of all games, where there is a written ruleset explaining how players can change the game's rules, often democratically. 

in SfN, you change the rules by writing a "proposal" and having people vote on it. 
a proposal can be anything from "i win now" to "there's a shop and u can buy items and use them to make stuff happen". anything is possible! 

the purpose is to experiment, and design a game *while* playing it (or if u wanna win, find loopholes and break the game to your favor). 

there's no requirement to actually participate, so it's entirely possible to join the server just to check it out or watch from the sidelines. the game can last anything from 3 minutes to 30 years, and will progress however fast we want. do nothing, everything, anything!
